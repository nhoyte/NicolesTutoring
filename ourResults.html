	<h2><u>Our Results</u></h2>
	<p>
	Our mission is to ensure that all students develop the strong foundation 
	in math and enthusiasm for academics needed for long-term success.
	<br><br>
	98% of over 1,500 students to date have met program growth goals in math.
	Heart uses 45-minute, research-based, one-on-one assessments, to measure 
	progress across twelve foundational math concepts that are proven to be critical for long-term 
	success in math. The program target, established under the guidance of CMS and endorsed by Dr. Drew 
	Polly of UNC Charlotte, is that students show growth in 2+ concepts. 80% of 2016/17 Heart students 
	grew in four or more concept areas- double our goal!
	<br><br>
	
	94% of teachers in 2016/17 observed an increase in student confidence toward math.
	65% of teachers reported students' confidence increased in subjects other than math. 
	96% of tutors believe they had a positive influence on students' confidence about and understanding of math.
	<br><br>
	
	100% of volunteers and 93% of teachers rated their experience positive in 2016/17.
	99% of volunteers would recommend tutoring with Heart to friends and colleagues, and 96% 
	believed they had a positive influence on students.
	<br><br>
	
	84% of teachers said their experience with Heart was more positive than other experiences 
	based on clear communication, the quality of instruction, and minimal time required of teachers.
	<br><br>

	(>500 volunteer survey responses, 85% teacher response rate)
	</p>
	<br>

	<h2>Conceptual Focus Areas:</h2>
	<p>
	After being assessed one-on-one in all relevant concept areas, students are placed in the lowest 
	concept they have not yet mastered and work through one concept at a time.

	<h2>What people say about Nicole's Tutoring:</h2>
	<p>
	"With just a few short weeks under her 2nd grade belt, C is thriving in math class this year! 
	Last year she dreaded math classwork and math games, this year she's enthusiastic and craving 
	more from her teacher. I can solely attribute her success and positive attitude to Nicole's Tutoring. 
	Thanks to the team for all you do!"
	-Sincerely, D. W.
	<br><br>
	
 	"Well-organized sessions and terrific tutors have really helped to reinforce concepts for my daughter. 
 	She has gained so much confidence in math, and her dad and I have been able to keep our sanity!"
 	-D.H.
	<br><br>

	"I've been very happy with my child's experience with Nicole's Tutoring! It is very easy to schedule 
	appointments online. Every instructor has worked very well with my child. I feel it is a positive 
	learning environment."

	<br><br>

 	"Krista and staff, We love Nicole's Tutoring. All my daughters have blossomed in math and went from average 
 	students to top of the class and most importantly, they learned to LOVE the subject. Now that my older 
 	daughters are in high school they are getting so many opportunities because of their strong math skills. 
 	And my rising middle schooler is doing great! Thanks you you and your staff!"
 	-D.R.

	greatly improved his confidence in tackling problems."
