	<h2><u>About Us</u></h2>

		<p>
		
		Nicole's Tutoring became reality when director, Nicole, realized the need for this type 
		of help for local students. As more and more families approached Nicole asking 
		for help with their children's schooling, she saw a need for enrichment programs and supplemental 
		opportunities to go alongside traditional schooling. Nicole's Tutoring was born out of a desire 
		to help students of all ability levels who needed this educational enrichment.
		<br><br>
		
		Each student who comes to Nicole's Tutoring begins with a diagnostic test to
		identify areas where they need more help. This allows us to create a personal learning program to 
		fill in those gaps. 
		<br><br>
		
		If you are a student who is strugling or have a child who is struggling, Nicole's Tutoring is the answer. 
		We strive to bridge the gaps in students' understanding and bring any lacking skills to the mastery 
		level. Our certified teaching staff uses a variety of materials and methods to reach learners of all 
		types. Don't let school be a struggle any longer. Get the help and enrichment you need today! <br><br>
