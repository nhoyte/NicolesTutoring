	<h2><u>About Us</u></h2>

		<p>
		
		Nicole's Tutoring became reality when director, Nicole, realized the need for this type 
		of help for local children and their families. As more and more families approached Nicole asking 
		for help with their children's schooling, she saw a need for enrichment programs and supplemental 
		opportunities to go alongside traditional schooling. Nicole's Tutoring was born out of a desire 
		to help children of all ability levels who needed this educational enrichment.
		<br><br>
		
		Each student who comes to Nicole's Tutoring begins with a full battery of diagnostic tests. This 
		identifies areas where they need more help, and allows us to create a personal learning program to 
		fill in those gaps. Our students do very well with our system, showing a full grade level of improvement 
		after 40 hours of instruction.
		<br><br>
		
		If your child is struggling, Nicole's Tutoring and our dedicated team of specialists is the answer. 
		We will help bridge the gaps in your child's understanding and bring any lacking skills to the mastery 
		level. Our certified teaching staff uses a variety of materials and methods to reach learners of all 
		types. Don't let school be a struggle any longer. Get the help and enrichment you need through today! <br><br>
